# ðŸ§  Model Merging Project

This repository explores merging fine-tuned language models to evaluate task-specific performance improvements. The goal is to test whether combining representations from specialized models (e.g., medicine, toxicity) can produce a single model with enhanced multi-domain performance.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/model-merging-project.git](https://github.com/Shardul2003/model-merging.git)

# Enter directory
cd model-merging

# Open files: Once in folder, type
jupyter notebook
# to launch the Jupyter Notebook server

# Note: If Jupyter Notebook is not installed, it can be done through
pip install notebook

# This will open the Jupyter Notebook server and display all files in the current directory, from where they can be accessed
